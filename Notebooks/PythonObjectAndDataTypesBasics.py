"""Variables
        Rules for variable names
            Cannot start with a number
            No spaces
            Best practice that names are lowercase
            Avoid special wirds in Python 'list' 'str'
        Python uses dynamic typing
            Can reassign variables to different data types
            Can use type() to find type of a variable

# a = 5
# a = 10

# a = 30.1

# print(type(a))

# my_income = 100

# my_taxes = my_income * taxRate
# print(my_taxes)
