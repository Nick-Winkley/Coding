Lists 
    Lists are ordered sequences that can hold a variety of object types.
    They use [] brackets and commas to separate objects in the list
        [1,2,3,4,5]
    Lists support indexing and slicing. 
    Lists can be nested and also have a variety of useful methods that can be called off of them
